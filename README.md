## 🛠️ Local Setup Guide

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate  # (Windows)
source .venv/bin/activate # (Mac/Linux)

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment variables
copy .env.example .env

# Start the server
python app.py
```

- Backend available at: `http://localhost:5000`

---

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Setup environment variables
copy .env.example .env

# Start the React app
npm start
```

- Frontend available at: `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend proxies requests to backend automatically.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

### Backend `.env.example`

```plaintext
# Recommended
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://codegen-ui-xi.vercel.app
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=CodeGen UI

# Optional direct-OpenAI fallback
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

OpenRouter is the default provider for modern model presets. Current presets include GPT-OSS 20B/120B, Qwen3 Coder, DeepSeek V3.2, Qwen3 Coder Next/Flash, and GLM 5.3. The backend keeps direct OpenAI support for legacy model IDs.

---

### Frontend `.env.example`

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 📦 Deployment

| Layer    | Platform           |
|----------|--------------------|
| Backend  | Railway / Render    |
| Frontend | Vercel / Netlify    |

- Set environment variables correctly on the deployment platform.
- Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` in frontend to your deployed backend URL.
